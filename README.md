dotfiles
========

This is where I store my dotfiles under version control. Perhaps they will be useful to someone, somewhere. They are symlinked to my home directory with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

= Neovim

For a basic nvim config, follow the [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install/) instructions.
